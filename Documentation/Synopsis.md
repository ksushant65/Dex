Air Gesture Recognition
==========================
Recognizing User's Hand Gestures to interact with Google Chrome browser.

### Introduction

In this day and age, where interaction with electronic devices is an indispensable part of our life styles, every day we are innovating new ways to interact with our gadgets. As touch screens become the norm, most devices now sport a high-definition capacitive touch display. But the presence of front-facing cameras in many such devices opens possibilities of a new and more intuitive method of interaction with these devices. The use of gestures to control the device is not a new concept, but needs more effort, innovation and improvements.

The aim of our project is to create an application that detects and recognizes a user's hand gestures using the device's webcam, and allows the user to interact with their browser in a hands-free mode.

### Project Description

Our project mainly revolves around detection and recognition of user's hand gestures by using their webcam (or any another capture device attached). The device will be used to track the user's hand in real-time using image processing. On detection of a registered gesture, an action associated with it is executed by the system.

### Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Detect and track user's hand in real-time.
2. Recognize registered gestures.
3. Interface with the Google Chrome web browser.

### Platforms and Tools

The application will function on the following platforms:
1. Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10
2. Various Linux Distros (Ubuntu, Mint, CentOS, Fedora etc)
3. Mac OS X
4. Any other platform that supports Google Chrome

Other Requirements for the sysetm are:
1. Python installation
2. WebCam (on-board or external)
3. Google Chrome v41.0+
4. OpenCV 2.7+ installation

Tools used to develop this application are:
1. Python 2.7.9
2. Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib)
3. OpenCV 2.4.x
4. Google Chrome API
